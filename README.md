Simple Pendulum simulation using opengl and C++

A simple pendulum consists of a rod and a mass. The mass is connected to the rod which swings freely about its piviot.

the equation of motion for a simple pendulum is:
ɑ = -(g/r)sin(θ)

where ɑ is the angular acceleration
g is the gravitational constant
r is the radius
and θ is the angle measured from the resting position of the pendulum
